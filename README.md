# Modified Code Refactor Starter Code for Accessibility

## Description

The source code is a website for a company called Horiseon which promotes their ability to improve other websites by including search engine optimization, online reputation management, and social media marketing.

My adjustments to this code was to improve reader clarbility in the code and added the alt atttribute to images for better accessibility. A proper title was also added.
